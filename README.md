## Preprocessing iris flower dataset:
Various pre-processings were done in this project.
1. Missing values were recognized and dropped
2. **One-hot encoding** have been used for encoding _categorical features_
3. _Numerical features_ were normalized using **StandardScaler** 
4. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** have been used for dimensionality reduction (4D to 2D)
5. Reduced features have been visualized
6. Original Dataset(without NaN-values) have been visualized using Box plot
### Results:
**PCA output**
